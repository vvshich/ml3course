# Machine Learning models
## Models
I`ve learned and used models:
1. KNN,
2. Decesion Tree,
3. Random Forest,
4. Linear and Logistic Regressor,
5. MLP Classifier,
I`v also used ensembles like Bagging and Boosting with different basic models.
## Scoring
To evaluate models I`v used various metrics like:
* R2,MSE score for regressor, 
* accuracy_score, f1_score for classifier.
## Resources
First five files using dataset from kaggle: [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thehapyone/uci-online-news-popularity-data-set/data). 

Last file use another dataset from Vodaphone.
## Final project
Final project summarizes all that I have learned in this course.
